# Polybar Themes
## Polybar configurations I have made and/or used on my system

- These have all been tested on my system
- Some of the modules require one of my scripts to run
- Please read through the configuration of each theme to verify if any of my scripts or any dependencies are needed for theme to work correctly.
- Polybar_2 theme is in separate file from modules
